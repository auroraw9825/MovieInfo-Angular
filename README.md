# MovieInfo-Angular
 
A webpage that allows you to search for information regarding movies and TV shows using the TMDB API and upon selection can display results on the details page of that specific movie or TV show. You can view popular, top-rated and trending movies and TV shows in a carousel on the home page along with currently playing movies. 

- Implemented carousels with movie/tv cards to show pop-up options and share on Facebook and Twitter with Intents.
- Integrated a SearchBar listener to call MultiSearch endpoint each time the query changed and show the dynamic result list.
- Developed multiple fragments and activities for Detail page with **YouTube player**, trim text view, Glide, etc.
- Incorporated Watchlist Fragment with drag & drop feature, and persist items across sessions using **localStorage**.
